# Round Engine

This is Round Engine! A new engine for friday night funkin'.

# Features

1. First of all, it has a crap load of features straight of the bat. It has a full options menu that catagorises all of the options really well! including an offset menu.

2. It has 3 seperate offset settings: Audio Offset (so audio aligns with chart), Input/Judgement Offset (changes scores based on input delay), And visual offset (for screen lag).

3. It has 4 keysets: 4k, 6k, 8k, 9k. (with proper keybinds!!)

4. It allows toggling between ghost tapping, botplay, and accuracy system mid game.

5. It also allows changing the amount of keys mid game. (so you can go from 4 to 9 keys if you want).

6. Thorns ummmm.... doesn't work....

7. All the standard crap: Downscroll, Ghost Tapping, FPS cap, pretty much anything from psych/kade engine.

8. Custom and reliable input system known only as round input.

# Charting Features

Now this is based off of the slightly older than the latest version of the base game. With a few features taken from psych engine, but the chart editor is a bit primitave. HOWEVER! I will still list a couple things.

1. Hold notes have matching colours

2. Changing keys mid song (listed earlier)

3. New chart system (still compatible with old charts). Just untick the legacy chart system box.

4. By pressing X / Z you can change grid zoom. WHICH, unlike psych engine, allows triplets.

5. Change ui box thing from the left to the right of the screen.

# Why?

This started out as a joke, but I figured this sorta- has a chance at working. Tho IK this won't get any bit popular. Do I care tho? no.
